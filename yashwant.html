                Hi, I am Yashwant. I am responsible for conceptualizing and developing the following business cases for Agartha — a new, self-sufficient, and sustainable city with a population of 4 million, located between Pune and Nashik near the banks of the Pravara River. These ideas are designed to support Agartha's long-term growth, improve quality of life, and align with global development goals.
