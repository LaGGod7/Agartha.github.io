                <p>This addresses **SDG 11.5** (Reduce Damage from Disasters), which is critical for a city located near a river prone to monsoonal flooding.</p>
                <p>A smart, monitored drainage system is essential for diverting excess rainwater and preventing urban flooding in low-lying and newly developing areas.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Protecting critical city infrastructure, including roads, power lines, and housing, from water damage.</li>
                    <li>Minimizing economic losses and human displacement caused by seasonal flooding.</li>
                    <li>Integrating natural water retention methods (like permeable pavements and green infrastructure).</li>
                    <li>Strengthening the city's overall resilience against the increasing effects of climate change.</li>

                <p>This initiative is paramount for **SDG 6.1** (Universal and Equitable Access to Safe and Affordable Drinking Water) and **SDG 6.4** (Sustainable Water Withdrawal and Supply). Water security is a top priority for a 4-million-person city relying on the Pravara River.</p>
                <p>A smart system will utilize real-time monitoring and analytics to ensure water quality, prevent leaks, and manage consumption efficiently across the city.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Guaranteeing safe, high-quality drinking water for every resident in Agartha.</li>
                    <li>Reducing water losses in the distribution network through leak detection and repair.</li>
                    <li>Optimizing water usage in industrial and agricultural zones to conserve the river's resources.</li>
                    <li>Improving the resilience of the water supply against drought conditions or seasonal shortages.</li>
